                    <h3>Fox Hall in the snow</h3>
                    <p>I took this picture last febuary when it snowed heavily in Lowell and i 
                        thought the atmosphere made fox hall look pretty cool</p>

                    <h3>Industrial</h3>
                    <p>I really like this photo as the color pop really well and the centering of the 
                        building made this a very appealing photo to look at for me. this was taken behind 
                        River Hawk Village and the building in the image is one of the apartments by the river walk.

                    <h3>Red Moon</h3>
                    <p> I took this picture back home in D.C. on my friends rooftop. When we hung out at this house in 
                        particular we would get really nice sunsets and often times we could see the moon coming up, in
                         this picture I was able to capture the Moons red color as it was coming up.</p>

                    <h3>Mysterious</h3>
                    <p>I took this image last spring semester after it had rained for a couple days and noticed how much 
                        fog there was in lowell and since i loved the Mysterious and omenous vibe it gave off i snapped a 
                        picture and edited it a bit to make the fog more aperant</p>

                    <h3>City Over Growth</h3>
                    <p> i took this picture by the Tsongas center and i really liked how over grown the greenery was 
                        and so i decided to snap a pic of it because it felt so out of place for it to be in a city.</p>
