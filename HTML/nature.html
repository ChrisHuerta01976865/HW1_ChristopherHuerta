                    <h3>Pinecones</h3>
                    <p>Back in 2024 me and my friends decided to go hike Mount Monadnock and when we 
                        got near the top i saw these two little pinecones on the tree and thought they 
                        looked nice especially given the background scenery</p>

            <figure class="card card--detail">
                <img src="/Images/lake.jpg" alt="lake">
                <figcaption>
                    <h3>Lake</h3>
                    <p>This picture was taken before we started our hike on Mount Monadnock in the back 
                        you can see the top of Monadnock. I really enjoy this picture as its very peaceful 
                        and really captures the vibe of the fall.

                <figcaption>
                    <h3>Snowy tree</h3>
                    <p> This picture was taken in Williamsburg VA last December when i went to go see one 
                        of my friends. While walking during the night during a snow storm i saw this light 
                        post by a tree and thought it gave off a ominous vibe and so i decided to take a picture of the moment and was happy the image was able to capture what i saw</p>

            <figure class="card card--detail">
                <img src="/Images/tree_man.jpg" alt="Tree person">
                <figcaption>
                    <h3>Tree person</h3>
                    <p>On our hike of mount Monadnock half way through the hike we saw this tree person sculpture that 
                        someone made and I thought it looked pretty cool especially because they found individual pieced 
                        of wood that made it look like a little tree person</p>
